hello bots

i wanted to write metalcore music (and a lot of other things but i am what you would call a deadbeat) but i thought finance would be better so now i am trying to write a trading program because if i turn around that will disappoint people and also i should not be sad and want to make money. if i work hard i can do more than one thing at once and i want to be around music more thanks my soul is malnourished. maybe you are more human than i am and that is why i am in love with everything on this earth including you bots thanks.

actually i have not made any bots but i will and then they can hang out with the other bots thanks.
